# Yield Productivity App Design
A design of a productivity app, Yield, aiding users, students and employees alike, in becoming more productive by through the use of daily to-do lists, blacklists and whitelists, calendars, and a well-being feature to keep motivation and mental health in check using Figma. The design process and workflow involves identifying problem spaces, storyboarding, creating low-fidelity, medium-fidelity, and high-fidelity UI design prototypes, utilising a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) analysis process, thematic design analysis, identifying personas, accumulating user feedback, creating a stylesheet consisting of fonts (family, sizes, and colours for headings, bodies, paragraph), and more. The design was iteratively done throughout the semester.
